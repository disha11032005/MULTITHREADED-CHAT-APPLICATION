# DESCRIPTION

In this task, we developed a client-server chat application using Java Sockets and multithreading. The server listens for incoming client connections and creates a separate thread for each connected client to handle multiple users simultaneously. Clients can send and receive messages in real time through the server. This project demonstrates networking concepts, socket programming, and multithreading in Java to enable concurrent communication between multiple users
